# Machine learning tutorials

This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in Python. All algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. The intention of these notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the algorithms and their underlying structure, *not* to provide the most efficient implementations.
